ros-hydro-hironx-ros-bridge (1.0.11-1quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Moved from googlecode.com to github.
  * (hironx_client.py) Documenting a bunch. Removed humanoid specific methods.
  * (hironx.py) fix to #14 <https://github.com/start-jsk/rtmros_hironx/issues/14>
  * add checker program for robot's internal os
  * (test-hironx.py) quick fix to get it run with a real robot. This needs enhancement for versatility. Also removed test_goOffpose that interrupt the testing sequence by turning down servo.
  * Fix the same issue with https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/issues/25#issuecomment-32332068 by the same patch (https://github.com/tork-a/rtmros_nextage/commit/d4268d81ec14a514bb4b3b52614c81e708dd1ecc#diff-20257dd6ad60c0892cfb122c37a8f2ba)
  * (hironx.py) Use generic name for the robot instance. This enables users on the script commandline (eg. ipython0 to run the same commands without asking them to specifically tell what robot they're using (eg. hiro, nxc). This is backward compatible so that users can still keep using hiro.
